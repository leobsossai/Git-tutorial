When we first initialized our project, the file was not being tracked by Git. 
To do that, we use this command git add . The period or dot that comes after add means all the files that exist in 
the repository

If you want to add a specific file, maybe one named about.txt, you use git add about.txt

To help you deepen your understanding of file stages, I will make changes to the file and then push the new 
version to GitHub
